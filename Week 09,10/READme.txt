In these weeks I learned about state management in flutter through Riverpod. In it, I explored different state providers and to use it according to the requirement.The providers include:
=> Provider
=> State Provider
=> State Notifier Provider
=> Change Notifier Provider
=> Future Provider
=> Stream Provider
=> Scoped Provider

Moreover in future provider we can also have autoDispose and family functionalities. Few providers are attached in this folder.
