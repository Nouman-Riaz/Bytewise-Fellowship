In this week, I learned about: 
==>  Introduction to Flutter
==>  Prerequisite of installing Flutter
==>  How to install Flutter
==>  Dart Programming language (Language used in Flutter for building apps)

After that, I made a Flutter app by taking the first codelab. In this codelab, I learned about different Widgets, their properties and childrens, creating layout,
navigation rails, connecting user interactions (like button presses) to app behavior, making the app responsive and further more the basics of flutter and how it works.
Also in this week-02 folder, I attached the code of my first Flutter app.
==> Brief introduction to this app:
                                  The app generates cool-sounding names, such as "newstay", or "graypine" etc. The user can ask for the next name, favorite the current 
one, and review the list of favorited names on a separate page. The app is responsive to different screen sizes.
