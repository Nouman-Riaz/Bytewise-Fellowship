In this week, I learned about different widgets which includes:
=> Container
=> CircleAvatar
=> ListTile
=> ListView
=> TextFormFields
=> SizedBox
=> Divider
=> Column
=> Row
=> Padding
=> Stateful vs Stateless Widgets
 
 and much more. Also learned about their different properties which helps to decorate the UI. The practice code of these widgets is attached in Week-03 folder.
