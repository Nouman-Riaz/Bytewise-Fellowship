In these weeks, I learned about different things which includes:
=>  Adding interactivity to the app
=>  Adding assets 
=>  Navigation and Routing
=>  Animations

Adding interactivity to the app:
                                 We can add interactivity to the app by different ways, one way which I used in my app is by using stateful widgets. I learned about how to use these type 
widgets like for example in radio buttons, food ordering apps when a user selects the things and then price changes automatically etc.

Adding assets:
              In this, I learned about how to add different assets in my app for various purposes. First, we have to add it on pubspec.yaml file and then by using AssetImage() or 
NetworkImageURL etc, we can use them in our app like I use them as my background image for my app. We can also add just simply the directory in pubspe.yaml file of all assets to access  
them rather than by putting them one by one in it.

Navigation and Routing:
                        One of the most important thing which I learned in these weeks are navigation and routing. In it, I learned how to navigate between screens and also how to pass 
data between them. For that purpose I made five different dart files:
                =>main.dart         =>home_screen.dart      =>screen2.dart      =>screen3.dart      =>RouteNames.dart       =>Routes.dart
The last two dart files are for the routes which includes the name of routes and the functionality to pass data between screens as Hashmaps and navigate to the appropriate screen.
In my app, I used the practical/professional method of routes for navigation.

Animations:
            In this, I learned about different animation widgets which helps to show the widgets beautiful and looking like 3D models.
